# MyClassifier
The goal was to automate the detection of the nature of messages before forwarding them to the right support agent.
First, as the language worked on is not a well-formed language we needed to get labeled data which we manually did, 
second, we used an already existing language model ( BERT in this case ) and fine-tuned it with the data already labeled.
The result is a classification model that classifies can classify messages correctly. 
Thus customers became more satisfied as the response time has decreased dramatically which makes the business more attractive to potential costumers.
